# Pynbody2Gadget: Simulation Format Converter
This python code loads galaxies from a cosmological simulation using pynbody and converts them into multi-file Gadget (binary) or single-file Gadget-HDF file formats. This code (especially the Gadget-HDF converter) was made with the Romulus25 simulation (Nchilada format) in mind and adapted to work as an input to the Powderday radiative transfer simulation and thus may require some adjustment for other simulations.
